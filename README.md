# Insider Trading Machine Learning Analysis

For our final project, we utilized data engineering principles to implement a machine learning model that predicts forward returns over a 21-day span upon an initial stock investment. We analyzed data from publicly accessible insider trades (government and business officials) in order to assist our ROI.

Utlizing both classification and regression techniques, the algorithm correctly predicts the sign of return at a ~61% rate with a ~1.5% return on investment.
